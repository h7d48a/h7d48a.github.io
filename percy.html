	During a conversation between Apollo and Jason in Edgraton Day and Boarding School, the Roman demigod reveals to the exgod that, when he found the Sybil in the Labyrinth, she gave to him a dreadful prophecy: if Jason chooses to face Caligula, either he or Piper would die. Also, apparently the Sybil said the word die with such an intonation that could only mean permanent death, much to Apollo's horror.
